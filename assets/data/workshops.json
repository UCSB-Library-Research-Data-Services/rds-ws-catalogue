      "summary": "",
      "description": "Are you wondering if there’s a better way to collect information from digital archives, libraries, and museum collections than downloading items one by one? In this workshop, we will explore how to take advantage of API services provided by cultural institutions using Python to collect and structure data and digital artifacts. Using open cultural heritage data from the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), participants will retrieve a sample of digital objects and relevant metadata, simulating a real research scenario. The session introduces key concepts such as pagination, filtering, and basic data inspection, with a focus on realistic data collection workflows.",

In this hands-on workshop, we will learn why protocol sharing matters and guide you through building a step-by-step protocol. We will introduce core features, highlight advanced tools, and discuss how Protocols.io fits alongside other methods sharing options. By the end of the session, you will understand how to adapt protocols.io for your research workflow and use it to support reproducible, well-documented research.\nResearchers from all disciplines are welcome, including those documenting lab procedures, computational workflows, or qualitative methods such as interview guides. While everyone is welcome, this workshop will be of particular interest to graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.\nThis event may be photographed or recorded.",

We’ll use Obsidian, a free, flexible, and local-first note-taking app, to show how you can build a system for documenting your research thinking in plain-text files that you fully control.\nYou’ll learn how to link ideas, structure your notes, and even sync your notes to GitHub for safe, long-term storage, all without needing any coding experience.

Are you interested in organizing your research data in a proper database, but SQL still feels like too big a leap?\nNo-code databases provide a middle ground. They allow you to create structured, relational data models and benefit from the efficiency of a database engine without needing to write queries or manage complex infrastructure.\nIn this workshop, we’ll introduce the core ideas behind no-code databases, explore several open-source options, and guide you through installing and setting up your first local database. You’ll leave with a clearer understanding of how these tools can support research, collaboration, and sustainable data management.\nThis event may be photographed or recorded.",
