SUMMARY:Collecting Cultural Heritage Data with the DPLA API
DESCRIPTION:Are you wondering if there’s a better way to collect information from digital archives\, libraries\, and museum collections than downloading items one by one? In this workshop\, we will explore how to take advantage of API services provided by cultural institutions using Python to collect and structure data and digital artifacts. Using open cultural heritage data from the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)\, participants will retrieve a sample of digital objects and relevant metadata\, simulating a real research scenario. The session introduces key concepts such as pagination\, filtering\, and basic data inspection\, with a focus on realistic data collection workflows.\n\n---\nFormat: Online\nInstructor(s): Jairo Melo\nResearch Area(s): Data management\, Humanities\nQuarter: Winter 2026\n

SUMMARY:Document Your Research Thinking w/ Obsidian
DESCRIPTION:Research isn’t just about collecting sources or writing papers\, there’s a crucial middle stage where ideas take shape: reading\, reflecting\, drafting\, and making connections.\nThis workshop explores how to treat research notes as valuable data — information that deserves to be organized\, preserved\, and revisited. We’ll use Obsidian\, a free\, flexible\, and local-first note-taking app\, to show how you can build a system for documenting your research thinking in plain-text files that you fully control.\nYou’ll learn how to link ideas\, structure your notes\, and even sync your notes to GitHub for safe\, long-term storage\, all without needing any coding experience. This workshop is open to everyone\, but will be of particular interest to graduate students\, faculty\, and staff.\nThis event may be photographed or recorded.\n\n---\nFormat: In person\nInstructor(s): Jairo Melo\nResearch Area(s): Data management\, Humanities\nQuarter: Winter 2026\n\nRegister: https://ucsb.zoom.us/meeting/register/9pPUAmWoRCGrw5PXroITZg
